      Data feed service is based on Calvin K's data feed contribution. The basic functions were retained but the rest of the internal code was changed to follow OSC Style of coding. Along with the coding change an admin interface was introduced to manage the feed configuration. With these coding changed and the addition of a admin the process was split into 4 steps. Not all of the steps are required for each feed you do.</td>
