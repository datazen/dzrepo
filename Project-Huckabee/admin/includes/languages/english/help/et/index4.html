Once you have finished editing a define, click on the save next to the define. This will
save the edit you made. You will return to the define edit screen so you can check you changes if for some reason it is not
correct you can click on the restore and this will revert the file back to what it was before the save.

Language define files have variables in them. If for some reason one of these get changed you can always revert back
to the file before editng by clicking on restore. A restore button will apear after you save your edits.
click on the &quot;Restore File&quot; button at the top of the page.  The file will then take on
the contents it had prior to the last change.

You should always check your changes between each save.

This works both in MS1 and MS2.
