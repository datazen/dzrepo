PayPal has optimized their checkout experience by launching an exciting new improvement to their payment flow.
<br/><br/>For new buyers, signing up for a PayPal account is now optional. This means you can complete your payment first, and then decide whether to save your information for future purchases.
<p>To pay by credit card, look for this button:<br/>
<p align="center"><?php echo tep_image(DIR_WS_MODULES . 'payment/paypal/images/PayPal-ContinueCheckout.gif','','',''); ?></p>
<br/>
Or you may see this:<br/>
<p align="center"><?php echo tep_image(DIR_WS_MODULES . 'payment/paypal/images/PayPal-no-account-Click-Here.gif','','',''); ?></p>
<br/>
One of these options should appear on the first PayPal screen.<br/>
<p>Note: if you are a PayPal member, you can either use your account,
or use a credit card that is not associated with a PayPal account.
In that case you'd also need to use an email address that's not associated with a PayPal account.</p> --><?php echo INFO_CC_2;?>
