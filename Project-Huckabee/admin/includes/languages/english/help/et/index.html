<P>
This script allows you to quickly edit almost all displayed text on your Cre Loaded language files.
It is intended to replace define_languages.php, as the current define_languages.php has several problem.

<P>
Text is store in two places, the database and language defines files. Language Define Editor is
entended to edit the language define file within the /languages directory or a sub directory. All language defines
files should reside in the /languages directory. If they do not then the contributon does not
meet OSC or Cre Loaded standerds

<P>
Language define files have variables in them. If for some reason one of these get changed you can always revert back
to the file before editng by clicking on restore. A restore button will apear after you save your edits.
click on the &quot;Restore File&quot; button at the top of the page.  The file will then take on
the contents it had prior to the last change.

You should always check your changes between each save.

This works both in MS1 and MS2.
